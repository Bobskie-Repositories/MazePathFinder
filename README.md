# MazePathFinder


- I modified the outline of the application and made it into 13x10
- In the "wall" or obstacle of the maze, it will indicate a different color with an 'X' mark.
- I also added a new Informed searching algorithm called Greedy Best First Search.
- The implemented Greedy Best First Search incorporates queue behaviour with the lowest heuristic value
  to be be put in the queue first.
- Without using the queue behaviour, it would sometimes get stuck or it doesn't reach the goal
- I implemented a Manhattan distance for the heuristic value that changes according
  to the destination or goal.
- I added a feature where you can see the numbers that passes through in the path from the initial state to goal
